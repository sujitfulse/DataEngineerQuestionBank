1	What do you mean by a data lake?
==>	A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. 
        It can store data in its native format and process any variety of it, ignoring size limits.

2       explain data modeling 
==>     Data modelling is the process of conceptualizing and visualising how data will be gathered, stored, and used within business operations.
       Some of the benefits of data modeling include:
	A Improved understanding of data
	B Improved data quality
	C Improved collaboration
	D Increased efficiency

3	what is a data warehouse ?  what are data warehousing concepts ?
==>
	Used for analytical purposes. Optimized for aggregation and retrieval of large data sets.
	Data warehouses store data from multiple databases, which makes it easier to analyze.
	A data warehouse is an analytical database that layers on top of transactional databases to allow for analytics.	

4	diff b/w datelake and data warehouse ? 
==>     Data Lake ==> Data lake holds data of all structure types, including raw and unprocessed data. A kind of central strore. 
        Data Warehouse= > data warehouse stores data that has been treated and transformed with a specific purpose in mind,
                       which can then be used to source analytic or operational reporting.

5	facts and dimension ?
==>	
	Facts ==> 
	A fact is a quantitative piece of information - such as a sale or a download.
	Facts are trasacational numberic type of values. Big tables compared to fact tables.
	A fact table has two types of columns: fact columns and FK to dimenstional tables

	Dimension ==> 
	Descriptive characteristics in the companion table to the fact table.
	Gathering of background data about a company.
	Each dimension table has attributes that provide information about the specifics of the dimension.
	Each dimension in a dimension table contains a primary key column that uniquely identifies it.

6	Types of facts
==>
	Additive ==> Measurements in a fact table that can be summed up across all dimensions. e.g. storewise, daywise, product wise,
	Non - Additive => Facts that cannot be summed up across any dimension key. Note: % and ratio columns, , phone calls, orders, and sales.
	Semi-Aditive => Measurements in a fact table that can be summed up across only a few dimensions keys. e.g bank balance can not be sumed over time.
	Factless =>  A fact table without any measures is called the factless fact table. It contains only keys and  acts as a bridge between dimension keys

7	 SCD types ? Slowly Chaninging Dimensions
==> 
	Type 0 – No changes allowed. Fixed Dimension. Dimension never changes. e.g. account opening contry
	Type 1 – Overwrite. Update record directly, there is no record of historical values, only current state
	Type 2 – Add new Row, Row Versioning. Track changes as version records with current flag & active dates and other metadata
	Type 3 – Previous Value column. Track change to a specific attribute, add a column to show the previous value, which is updated as further changes occur
	Type 4 – History Table. Shosw current value in dimension table but track all changes in separate table
	Type 6 – Hybrid SCD. Utilise techniques from SCD Types 1, 2 and 3 to track change

8        Explain Differnt keys in DBs.


12	 what are data mart, data warehouse, data lake and data vault. How are these different ?

13	 what are star and snoflake schemas ? what schema is it if there are two fact tables ?

14	 what is normalization ? which form of normalization you used in the data ?
